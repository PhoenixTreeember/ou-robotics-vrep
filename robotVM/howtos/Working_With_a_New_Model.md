# Working With a New Model

If you create a new scene in the simulator, and drag a model into it, the model may be pre-configured with a child script that demonstrates some example behaviour when the simulator is started.

When controlling a robot from a script executed via the Jupyter notebooks, we need to ensure that any example scripts are prevented from running.

To do this;

1. select the robot object
2. select the scripts tool in the tool bar on the left hand side of the screen
3. select the child script you want to disable and then either:
	- delete it, *or*
	- check the disabled box.
