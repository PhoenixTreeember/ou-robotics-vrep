# Walking With Bill

*Walking Bill* is an animated human character that can be added to a V-REP scene to create a moving/walking human obstacle.

The *Bill on path* character comes with a path that the character will follow; the path can be reshaped. 

*(I'm not sure what hapens if there is an obstacle on the path?!)*
