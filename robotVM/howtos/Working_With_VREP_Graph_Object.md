# Working With VREP Graph Object

The graph object can be used to log and display data collected from the various objects that exist within a scene.

For example:

- the 2D graph object can be used to log and display sensor data in a 2D graph, plotting sensor value against time;
- the 3D graph object can be used to leave a trace behind the robot showing the trajectory followed by a particular part of it; (see [Pen Down - Robot Trajectory Trace](Pen_Down_Robot_Trajectory_Trace.md')).

## Clearing the Graph Buffer / Display
Open the graph dialogue, change the buffer size, close then reopen the graph window.

## Copying Data
Right click on graph legend raises a popip that lets you copy data to clipboard.

##Saving Data
Select a graph and the from menu bar `File -> Export selected graphs as CSV...`
